## Layout of the reporting platform

There are two sections of this reporting platform. The one where you are currently located displays the indicator set of the [Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/). The other section of the platform provides the indicators of the [German Sustainable Development Strategy](https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-en/issues/sustainability/) (Deutsche Nachhaltigkeitsstrategie, DNS). In both sections the time series on the respective indicators can be downloaded by interested visitors.

Next to the search box in the upper right corner of this page there is a direct link to the starting page of the national reporting platform to the indicator section of the German Sustainable Development Strategy: [<img src="https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/assets/img/about/DNS Wheel.png" alt="Wheel">](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io)

## Structure of the SDG part of the platform

The SDG part of the platform is organised into goals, targets and the related SDG indicators (figure 1).

## Presentation of single SDG indicators

Every SDG indicator is presented on an own page. Depending on the SDG indicator, there are different selection menus presented on the left hand side of each page. The first menu contains all time series that are available for this indicator. Depending on the time series, you can choose different values in the provided sub-menus below – i.e. different age classes.

The development of a time series is visualised in a chart. On the second tab “Table” – next to “Chart” – the chart data and all available data related from the sub-menus can be viewed (please have a look at figure 2).

Below the chart there are green buttons that allow data downloads in csv format and, in case of the chart, as well as a png file.

## Metadata and data sources

At the bottom of the indicator page three tabs are shown:
“National Metadata”, “Global Metadata”, and “Data Sources”

Below the tab “National Metadata” the national time series that are available and fit best the global metadata are listed. In addition, a comparison to the global metadata as well as further methodical and country-specific information on the time series can be found in the related national metadata sheet.

Every SDG indicator is administrated by one or more Custodian Agencies. After consultation with the IAEG-SDG, a statistical UN working group, the Custodian Agencies define the methodological guidelines for the calculation of the respective SDG indicator and publish those as global metadata. The global metadata can be found below the tab of the same name (figure 3). Here, the target is added in full length, as well as the [Tier classification](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs/tier-classification/) of the SDG indicator.

Below „Data Sources“ there are web links to the organisation:s, that provided the data for the time series, and – if possible ¬– there are web links directly to the particular data source.

## Comparison of SDG and DNS indicators

There are several overlaps in content in between the indicators of the Sustainable Development Goals and the German Sustainable Development Strategy.

Approximately half of the DNS indicators are similar or congruent with SDG indicators. Furthermore, both indicator sets are structured according to the 17 Goals of the UN agenda 2030, since the DNS represents the national implementation of the global agenda. More information about the DNS you can find in the category “Interesting Facts” and [DNS](https://sustainabledevelopment-germany.github.io/en/sdg-indicators/facts_dns/).

However, there are also differences. The name and especially the numbering of the DNS indicators is not identical with the SDG indicators. If there is a DNS indicator comparable to an SDG indicator, there is a button on the indicator page with a direct link to the respective indicator (figure 3).
